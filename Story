There was once a kingdom named KNOOOOOR. It's name could not be said by mortals.  
Within this land lived a race of superior beings that were often spoken of as gods.  
The myths of these beings were legendary.
It is said that they have hair like wind and speak with light.
*Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.*
They made weapons to fight the KNOORISH, those that made the sunlight burn out.
Without the sun they were weakened.
